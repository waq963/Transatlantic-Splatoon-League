<h3>Check-in</h3>
<p>All teams that want to play must check-in. Check-in opens 60 minutes before the tournament starts and closes 10 minutes before to allow some time for TO's to organize the bracket and change the seeding if needed. There is no exceptions made for latecomers.</p>
<h3>Roster</h3>
<p>One player may only play for one team for the entire tournament. Submitting roster beforehand is not mandatory but doing so is recommended for pick-ups. You can do it either with a DM to me or a post to #helpdesk.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Single Elimination with "Double Elimination like" Underground bracket so teams who already lost (sans Grand Final) can keep playing.</p>
<p>---</p>

<h3>Time limits</h3>
<p>You have a total of 30 minutes to finish a set of Bo3. 40 minutes for a Bo5. This time is from the result posted on #match-results that lets you know the opponent you are facing till you post the result of the match in question to the said channel.</p>
<p>Extra 5 minute grace period at the start of the tournament</p>
<p>Hearing back from your opponent shouldn't take longer than <strong>6 minutes</strong>. For everyone to join the room after it has been created and the opponent that you are talking to has been notified shouldn't take longer than <strong>7 minutes</strong>. Subbing shouldn't take longer than <strong>1 minute</strong>.</p>
<p>If your opponent is holding up the set let us know on #helpdesk or both teams might be punished for holding up the tournament. Please communicate any delays with us so we can run the tournament smoothly!</p>
<h3>Lag</h3>
<p>If a player you are facing is having connection problems to a level where it's greatly interfering with the game you can DM me after the tournament is done with video proof and we will consider taking action against this player for our future events. Notice that latency (that is caused by players living around the world) is not considered lag in this rule.</p>
<h3>Eligibility for the league</h3>
<p>Winner of the both tournaments is invited for TASL Season 1. You may add up to 8 players to your roster no matter who plays for you in this tournament.</p>
